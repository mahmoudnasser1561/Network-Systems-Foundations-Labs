# Network Systems Foundation Labs
This repository contains my completed labs from the "Network Systems Foundation" course by the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera. The labs cover key networking concepts such as link-layer protocols, TCP analysis, and BGP-like routing simulations.

## Labs
- **BGB_like_sim**: A Python classed based script simulating a BGP-like routing protocol.
- **Link_Layer**: A Jupyter notebook exploring Python Packet Manipulation Library Scapy in real world example.
- **Max_Bytes_In_Flight**: Tools and scripts for analyzing TCP max bytes in flight using `.pcap` files.
