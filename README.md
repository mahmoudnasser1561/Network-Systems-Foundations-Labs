# Network Systems Foundation Labs

This repository contains my completed labs from the "Network Systems Foundation" course by the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera. The labs cover core networking concepts, including link-layer protocols, TCP analysis, and BGP-like routing simulations. Each lab includes scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or packet capture files to demonstrate practical applications.

## Repository Structure
- `BGP_like_sim/`: Python script for simulating a BGP-like routing protocol.
- `Link_Layer/`: Jupyter notebook exploring packet manipulation with Scapy.
- `Max_Bytes_In_Flight/`: Tools and scripts for analyzing TCP max bytes in flight.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `LICENSE`: Project license (MIT).

## Labs
1. **BGP_like_sim**  
   A Python class-based script (`bgpLikeSim.py`) that simulates a simplified Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)-like routing system.  
   *Tags*: Python programming, routing protocols, network simulation.

2. **Link_Layer**  
   A Jupyter notebook (`lab-for-link-module.ipynb`) demonstrating packet manipulation using the Scapy library in a real-world networking scenario.  
   *Tags*: Link-layer protocols, packet crafting, Scapy.

3. **Max_Bytes_In_Flight**  
   Scripts (e.g., `FindMaxBytesInFlight.py`) and tools to analyze TCP max bytes in flight using packet capture (`.pcap`) files, including generated files like `out_10m_0p.pcap`.  
   *Tags*: TCP analysis, packet capture, network performance.
